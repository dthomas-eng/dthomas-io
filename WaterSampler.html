      <h3>UAV Water Sample Collector</h3>

      <p></p>
      <img class="projectimg" src="pictures/Assembled.PNG" />
      <p>
        During my first year of engineering school, I led a team to develop a
        drone-based water sample collection system. The idea for the project was
        based on a conversation I had with a water-researcher colleague who
        mentioned that the most tedious part of their work was spending 3-4
        hours a day traveling the banks of the Willamette river collecting
        surface water samples. We set off to create a system that could fly from
        the roof of the lab and gather samples from points in the nearby river.
      </p>

      <p>
        Initial funding was granted following a successful&nbsp;pitch to the PSU
        Beta project board. Additional funding was awarded as we progressed to
        the finals (placing 4th out of 25 entrants) of the CleanTech Challenge -
        a prototyping and pitching competition focused on environmental
        technology. We purchased a waterproof drone and outfitted it with our
        system.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <h4>Mechanical Design</h4>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        I designed and machined all of the mechanical elements of the collection
        devices and the custom landing gear. The final version of the water
        sample collector module (shown below) is the culmination of several
        iterative cycles over the span of the Summer. The collector module
        consists of a PTFE (Teflon) plunger actuated by a small solenoid. When
        the drone lands in water, a moisture sensor alerts a microcontroller and
        the solenoid is actuated allowing for a sample to be taken.

      <h4>Materials</h4>

      <p>
        To create the prototype, I learned how to machine Aluminum, Steel,
        Delrin, PTFE, and Viton. FDM and Stereolithography 3D printing were used
        to accelerate development and reduce cost. The landing gear is made from
        water-jet cut carbon fiber joined together with Aluminum spacers.
      </p>

      <p></p>

      <h4>Ease of Use</h4>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        Easy removal and handling of the samples following a collection mission
        was a big concern among the researchers we spoke with. The samplers are
        fully removable from the drone without tools. The samplers mount to the
        landing gear with thumbscrews and electrical connections are external,
        waterproof, and easily accessible. For easy transport, the landing gear
        can be removed from the drone as well.

      <h4>Results</h4>

      <p></p>

      <p>
        We were able to demonstrate functionality with short missions on ponds
        while remaining in the line of sight. FAA regulations prohibit fully
        autonomous use of drones, so we were unable to test our initially
        envisioned &quot;fly off the roof of the lab&quot; idea. Should these
        regulations change, this device is ready to be used by future water
        researchers.
